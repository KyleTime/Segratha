Welcome to my little project!

If you want to build this project for yourself, you're gonna need a GCC compiler, then you should be able to just run the "make" command to see what the project currently looks like.

If you actually do get that working, and the game is in any playable state, the controls should look like:

WASD - movement
SHIFT - go faster
1 - select SOLID material
2 - select SAND material
3 - select AIR material
mouse left click - place material

Have fun!
